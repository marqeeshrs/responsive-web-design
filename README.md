# responsive-web-design
learning HTML5 and CSS3 fundamentals in modern techniques and best practices for accessibility

Beginning with something that I think seems a little more on the fundamental side of coding
I am going to begin a project and see how updating files and such looks for me while using github

# cat-photo-app
Started with header implementation
Working on juggling git and markdown and workflow. Using this html project as a jump off for cementing better habits.
May need to create tutorial projects and become more engrossed in learning everything. YAAAAAY!
Also, very unsure when I am supposed to use branches... 
I guess that is for more complicated cooperation projects. 
I create versions of my projects, so it must be the same thing via network with extra protections.
Man, I just want to code... HA!
